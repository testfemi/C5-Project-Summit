# Cypress Testing for JobServe Features

This project contains automated end-to-end tests for the JobServe portal using Cypress. Below you will find instructions on how to run the tests in different modes, generate reports, and utilize the Cypress Dashboard for more interactive test runs.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows to keep the test management straightforward and maintainable:

- **`cypress/e2e/`**: Contains all end-to-end tests.
  - **`jobServe_features/`**: Feature files for JobServe-specific scenarios.
- **`cypress/fixtures/`**: Static data used in tests.
- **`cypress/support/`**: Utilities and helpers supporting tests, including Page Objects and step definitions.
- **`cypress/plugins/`**: Plugins to extend Cypress capabilities.
- **`cypress/reports/`**: Location for storing test run reports.

## Installation

Before running the tests, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install the project dependencies by running:
